# 🚶‍♂️ Step By Step 🎮  
**A Fitness-Powered Text-RPG Adventure**

---

## Overview  
**Step By Step** is a gamified step counter that transforms your real-world movement into energy for interactive storytelling. It's part fitness tracker, part narrative RPG — empowering users to walk, earn energy, and survive through immersive storylines.

The flagship story, **_Survive_**, drops players into a zombie apocalypse where every choice costs energy and survival depends on how much you've walked. New stories, genres, and experiences are planned for future releases.
