# 🚶‍♂️ Step By Step App 🎮

## Overview
**Step By Step** is a gamified step counter app that transforms real-world steps into energy points for an RPG adventure. The goal is to encourage movement while providing a fun, interactive narrative experience.

This project is evolving, and the current focus is on building a functional **dashboard** that displays step counts, converts them into energy, and allows players to engage with story-driven adventures. There are plans to integrate Apple's HealthKit for real-time step tracking and to expand the interactive story mechanics.

The first story, set in a post-apocalyptic world, will feature a protagonist navigating a transformed city following a sudden catastrophe. Future updates will expand into other genres, with users making choices that affect the storyline’s outcome.

## 🛠️ Current Features

  - **Step Counter**: Displays the number of steps taken toward a daily goal. A circular progress bar is planned for tracking step completion.
  - **Convert Steps to Energy**: A button that converts steps into energy points, which are used to progress in the story.
