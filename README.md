# 🚶‍♂️ Step By Step App 🎮

## Overview
**Step By Step** is a gamified step counter app that transforms real-world steps into energy points for an RPG adventure. The goal is to encourage movement while providing a fun, interactive narrative experience.

This project is in the **very early stages** of development. I am currently focusing on building a simple dashboard to display step counts and convert them into energy to be used in the game. There are plans to integrate Apple's HealthKit for real-time step tracking and to develop the interactive story mechanics.

The first story will be set in a post-apocalyptic world, but future updates will expand into other genres. Users will read through the story and make interactive choices that shape the outcome.

## What's Next
- 📊 HealthKit integration for live step tracking.
- 📖 Development of a story-driven experience using steps as an in-game resource.
- 🌟 Expansion of the narrative with choices, chapters, and alternate endings.
- 🗺️ Explore new genres and storylines beyond the initial post-apocalyptic theme.
