# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step By Step App üéÆ

## Overview
**Step By Step** is a gamified step counter app that combines fitness and storytelling. Real-world steps are converted into energy points, which players use to navigate an RPG-style narrative. This innovative app motivates physical activity while immersing users in interactive story-driven adventures.

The first story, *"Survive Step by Step"*, takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where players must make strategic decisions to survive a 10-day challenge. Future updates will introduce new stories and genres, providing fresh content to keep users engaged.
