# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step By Step App üéÆ

## Overview
**Step By Step** is a gamified step counter app that merges fitness with storytelling. It transforms real-world steps into energy points, motivating users to stay active while immersing themselves in interactive, RPG-style adventures. This app is more than a step tracker‚Äîit's a unique story-driven experience that rewards both physical activity and strategic gameplay.

The first story, *"Survive Step by Step"*, places players in a post-apocalyptic zombie world where survival is the ultimate challenge. The goal? Survive for 10 in-game days by making critical decisions that affect your fate. Future updates will expand into new genres and adventures.
