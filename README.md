# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step By Step App üéÆ

## Overview
**Step By Step** is a gamified step counter app that merges fitness with storytelling. By turning real-world steps into energy points, I encourage users to stay active while immersing themselves in interactive, RPG-style adventures. It's more than just a step tracker‚Äîit's a story-driven experience that motivates movement and rewards progress.

The first story, *"Survive Step by Step"*, takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where you must survive a 10-day zombie apocalypse challenge. Future updates will introduce new stories, genres, and features to keep things fresh and exciting.
